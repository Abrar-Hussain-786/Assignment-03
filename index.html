            <h4>Medical Biotechnology</h4>
            <p id="red">
                Medical biotechnology is the use of living cells and cell materials to research and produce
                pharmaceutical and diagnostic products that help treat and prevent human diseases. Most medical
                biotechnologists work in academic or industrial settings. Most medical biotechnologists work in
                academic or industrial settings.

            <h4>Industrial Biotechnology</h4>
            <p class="b2tech">
                Industrial biotechnology involves working with nature to maximize and optimize existing biochemical<br />
                pathways that can be used in manufacturing.

            <h4>Environmental Biotechnology</h4>
            <p class="b2tech">
                Environmental biotechnology is the branch of biotechnology that addresses environmental problems,
                such as the removal of pollution, renewable energy generation or biomass production, by exploiting
                biological processes.

            <h4>Animal Biotechnology</h4>
            <p id="yellow">
                Animal biotechnology is a branch of biotechnology <span> which molecular biology techniques are used to
                genetically engineer (i.e. modify the genome of) animals</span> in order to improve their
                suitability for pharmaceutical, agricultural or industrial applications.

            <h4>Plant Biotechnology</h4>
            <p id="green">
                Plant biotechnology is a set of techniques used to adapt plants for specific needs or opportunities.
                Plant biotechnologies that assist in developing new varieties and traits include genetics and genomics,
                marker-assisted selection (MAS), and transgenic (genetic engineered) crops.
